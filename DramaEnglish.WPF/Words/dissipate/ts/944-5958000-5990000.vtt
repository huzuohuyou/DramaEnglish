01:39:21.950 --> 01:39:24.960 
这里 我着陆的地方 水是碱性的...
Now, up here where I landed, the water is alkali...

2
01:39:25.290 --> 01:39:29.040 
空气中氨气浓度太高 呼吸几分钟就会受不了...
and the air has too much ammonia to breathe for more than just a few minutes...

3
01:39:29.210 --> 01:39:33.800 
但在冰面之下 还有一层地表...
but down at the surface, and there is a surface...

4
01:39:33.960 --> 01:39:35.590 
那里氯气消散了
the chlorine dissipates.

5
01:39:35.760 --> 01:39:39.640 
氨气也被结晶性烃和可呼吸的空气所取代
The ammonia gives way to crystalline hydrocarbons and breathable air,

01:39:39.970 --> 01:39:41.470 
可以支持有机体
to organics,

7
01:39:41.810 --> 01:39:44.140 
甚至可能是生命
possibly even to life.

01:39:44.980 --> 01:39:46.890 
我们也许不是这里唯一的活物
We might be sharing this world.

9
01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:49.400 
这些读数是地表上取得的?
These readings are from the surface?

10
01:39:49.560 --> 01:39:52.730 
这几年来 我放出了很多探测器
Over the years, I've dropped various probes.
