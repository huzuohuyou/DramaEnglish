00:17:18.530 --> 00:17:20.700 
在那座山上堆了一个月
sat on that hill for a month

2
00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:22.690 
然后滑进了我的热水浴池
before sliding into my hot tub.

3
00:17:22.690 --> 00:17:24.310 
你觉得是谁处理的
Who you think has to deal with that?

4
00:17:24.310 --> 00:17:27.380 
我猜是你的仆人或是园丁什么的
I assume your maid or gardener or something?

5
00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:30.620 
是的  但还是超级不爽
Well, yeah. But it's still super-obnoxious.

6
00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:32.310 
我才不要把那个娃娃还给你
You're not getting that doll back.

7
00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:33.500 
大家都是文明市民
Citizens, citizens.

8
00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:35.540 
作为加州未来的州长
As the future governor of California,

9
00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:39.020 
能利用意识形态光谱使大家达成妥协
I pride myself on probably being able to reach compromises

10
00:17:39.020 --> 00:17:41.130 
这是我引以为傲的事
across the ideological spectrum.

11
00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:43.550 
-不如我们把娃娃一分为二吧  -什么
- What if we cut the baby in half? - What?

12
00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:44.690 
-为什么要这么做  -不
- Why would we do that? - No.

13
00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:46.550 
所以你们都觉得这是个坏主意
So you both agree that's a bad idea.

14
00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:49.070 
也许你们也没有那么不同
Perhaps you're not so different after all?
