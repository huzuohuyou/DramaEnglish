00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.700 
-行吧  -什么事
- Okay? - What is it?

2
00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.570 
我直接见了你那位贝内克先生
Well, I went ahead and met with your Mr. Beneke,

3
00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:01.870 
本人正式再次强调  愚蠢
which I will say again, loudly and for the record, bad idea.

4
00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:05.740 
嗯  但总比坐牢强  对吗
Yes, but it is better than prison. Correct?

5
00:20:05.870 --> 00:20:07.010 
算是吧
Marginally,

6
00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:09.700 
所以我才按你说的把钱给了他
which is why I disbursed the funds as you requested.

7
00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:11.040 
很好啊
All right, good.

8
00:20:11.070 --> 00:20:13.600 
不过我不信他真的吃这套
Yeah, I can't believe he actually bought it--

9
00:20:13.770 --> 00:20:15.170 
突然就蹦出个"波吉特阿姨"
"Great-aunt Birgit."

10
00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:17.800 
简直胡扯  可你一意孤行
What? But you called it.

11
00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:20.300 
人们对眼皮底下招摇撞骗的垃圾
I guess people see those zeroes dance before their eyes,

12
00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:21.800 
都能够视而不见
it's kind of like highway hypnosis.

13
00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:23.350 
行了  到底什么情况
All right, so what's the problem?
