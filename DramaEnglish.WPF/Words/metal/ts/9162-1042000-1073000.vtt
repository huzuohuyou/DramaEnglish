1
00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:26.130 
我们得赶紧收尾了   琳
We got to wrap this up, Lin.

2
00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:27.360 
这对我们的生意可没好处
I mean, it's not great for business.

3
00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:29.110 
我们几乎把柜台给毁了
We totally screwed up the counter.

4
00:17:29.110 --> 00:17:30.020 
而且还没比出个结果
And nothing's settled.

5
00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:31.560 
反而引发了更多的问题
If anything, we've raised more questions.

6
00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:33.250 
我们依然是平局
I'm gonna say we're still even.

7
00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:34.830 
只剩最后一招了
And there's only one thing left.

8
00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:35.910 
菜刀对铁锤
Knife against hammer!

9
00:17:35.910 --> 00:17:37.050 
铁锤对菜刀
Hammer against knife!

10
00:17:37.050 --> 00:17:38.450 
铁对铁
Metal against metal!

11
00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:39.670 
不行  我们不来了
No way. We're-we're done.

12
00:17:39.670 --> 00:17:40.430 
平局也蛮好
A tie is good.

13
00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:41.910 
是的  鲍勃那么爱他那把刀
Yeah, Bob loves his knife.

14
00:17:41.910 --> 00:17:43.280 
我可不想毁了它
I'd hate to destroy it.

15
00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:45.580 
我的刀就是用铁锤做的  泰迪
My knife was made with hammers, Teddy.

16
00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:47.490 
用铁锤敲只会让它更结实
Hammering would actually make it stronger, so...

17
00:17:47.490 --> 00:17:49.280 
你尽管自我安慰吧
Whatever you want to tell yourself.

18
00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:50.590 
我先来
I get to go first!

19
00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:52.220 
五秒一局  开始
Five second rounds. Go!

20
00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:53.140 
芙纪绳  上
Fukinawa, go!
