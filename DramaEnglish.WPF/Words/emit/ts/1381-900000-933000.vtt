00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:03.230 
十分钟后我们会和一个神盾局小队在那碰头
Meeting a S.H.I.E.L.D. convoy there in 10.

2
00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:04.460 
很好
Good.

3
00:15:04.930 --> 00:15:06.810 
那这些好家伙就能派上用场了
Then you can show off these beauties.

4
00:15:08.390 --> 00:15:09.480 
这些都是"好梦"手枪吗
These all night-night guns?

5
00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:10.580 
用的是同样的技术
Based on the same technology,

6
00:15:10.590 --> 00:15:12.310 
但我们不再这么叫它们了
but we're not calling them that anymore.

7
00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:15.290 
-也该是时候了  -我叫它们冰冻枪

真不错
They're great.

10
00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:22.370 
你还减轻了那一盎司
And you lost the ounce.

11
00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:25.680 
而且我增强了三倍的阻滞力
And I tripled the stopping power.

12
00:15:26.970 --> 00:15:29.280 
但经过与麦克和蜈蚣战士的较量后
But I did realize after our run-ins with Mike

13
00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:30.750 
我明白
and Centipede...

14
00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:34.920 
抱歉  我们需要更强力的武器
Sorry. ...um, that we needed something stronger, better.
