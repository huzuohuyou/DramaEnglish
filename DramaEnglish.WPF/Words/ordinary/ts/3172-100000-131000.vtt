但我有点进退两难

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.170 
我普通晚上过得跟普通人的单身派对一样
my average night is like an average guy's bachelor party.

7
00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.550 
所以不要见怪  如果你俩真的在策划
So, no offense, but if you two plan it,

8
00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.580 
那肯定是平淡到  干嘛要等  极点
it's gonna be ordi-- why wait for it?-- nary.

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:56.800 
平淡无奇

你吗

你看起来是个好孩子

13
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.600 
但兄弟的未婚妻

14
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:03.860 
不能帮忙策划单身派对

15
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:05.140 
抱歉  你们俩得自食其力
Sorry. You two are on your own.

16
00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.600 
你们肯定会让我失望的
And you will disappoint me.

17
00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.670 
但记得让我失望得高兴点  好吗
But make it great, okay?

18
00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.550 
但这是一个很棒的开头
But this is a strong start.
