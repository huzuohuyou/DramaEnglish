00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.890 
我说过有这种可能
I did say this was a possibility.

2
00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.150 
就算神盾局能跟随我们
Even if S.H.I.E.L.D. can travel in our wake,

3
00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:02.970 
他们尚未发现我们的飞船
they have yet to discover our ship.

4
00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.030 
这是个优势
It is an advantage.

5
00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:06.230 
优势
Advantage?

6
00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.980 
我们本来有机会
We could have eliminated all of them

7
00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:11.130 
铲除他们所有人
when we had the chance.

8
00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:12.480 
请说明
Clarify.

9
00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.660 
凯恩被他们俘获了
Cain was in their captivity.

10
00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.760 
我们为何被设定为遭破坏后进行自毁
Why are we set to self-destruct when compromised?

11
00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.450 
我们应该设定为自爆
We should be set to detonate.

12
00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.350 
那样先进技术将散落在过去
Advanced technology would be scattered across the past.

13
00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.010 
那只会加快神盾局的成立
Which would only hasten the formation of S.H.I.E.L.D.

14
00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.970 
瞧
You see?

15
00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:27.790 
所以你只是猎人
This is why you are a Hunter
