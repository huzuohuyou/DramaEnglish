00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:48.722 
它们这么做 是出于自身原因吗
Like, is it for them?

2
00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:50.006 
不 我觉得是为我们着想
No, we think it's for us.

3
00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:52.801 
内厅的空气似乎不与外界流通
The air doesn't seem to circulate inside the chamber,

4
00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:55.804 
所以你们进去两小时后 就会感觉缺氧
so after about two hours, you run out of oxygen.

5
00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:57.357 
只不过是通风换气
It doesn't take 18 hours

6
00:21:57.358 --> 00:21:59.327 
不需要每次都等十八小时吧
to pump fresh air into a room.

7
00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:00.526 
大气成分
Atmosphere.

8
00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:03.647 
什么
Excuse me?

9
00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:06.166 
如果它们的大气成分与地球不同
If their atmosphere is different from Earth,

10
00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:07.685 
那么每次打开门前
it would certainly take hours

11
00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:09.762 
就真的需要十数小时
to rebalance the O2 content and pressure for us

12
00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:10.966 
来平衡压强与氧气含量
every time they open their door.

13
00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:14.402 
你是说 它们随时能让我们窒息而死吗
So, you're saying they could suffocate us if they wanted?

14
00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:16.409 
这是中央情报局的大卫·哈尔彭探员
This is Agent David Halpern with the CIA.
