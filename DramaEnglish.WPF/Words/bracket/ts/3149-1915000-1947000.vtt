00:31:55.150 --> 00:31:56.070 
I doubt it.

2
00:31:55.150 --> 00:31:56.070 
应该不要吧

3
00:31:58.040 --> 00:31:59.440 
Then I might have made a bit of

4
00:31:58.040 --> 00:31:59.440 
我可能把巴兹尔和斯皮罗之间的关系

5
00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:01.290 
a balls up over Basil and Spiros.

6
00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:01.290 
搞得一团糟了

7
00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:03.740 
By the way, I only wrote this

8
00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:03.740 
还有 我写这个仅仅只是

9
00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:05.270 
because Mother made us all write to

10
00:32:03.740 --> 00:32:05.270 
因为妈妈让我们都写信给你

11
00:32:05.270 --> 00:32:07.490 
- You in order to "look like a family". - "Look like a family."

12
00:32:05.270 --> 00:32:07.490 
- 好让我们看起来像一家人 - 看起来像一家人

13
00:32:07.490 --> 00:32:10.570 
So I'll say "goodbye" now then. Best wishes, Leslie.

14
00:32:07.490 --> 00:32:10.570 
所以我要说再见了 最好的祝愿 莱斯利

亲爱的 顽固的 莱斯

23
00:32:20.990 --> 00:32:23.620 
A more grudging letter has seldom come my way

24
00:32:20.990 --> 00:32:23.620 
我很少收到比你这封信更勉强的信件了

25
00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:25.090 
but thanks anyway as I know

26
00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:25.090 
但是不管怎么说 谢谢你

27
00:32:25.090 --> 00:32:27.990 
writing comes as naturally to you, as...

28
00:32:25.090 --> 00:32:27.990 
我知道写信对你来说简单的好比...
