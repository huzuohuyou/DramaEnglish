您也一定记得 博福特参议员当时...
Surely you must recall, sir, when senator Beaufort...

2
00:26:29.660 --> 00:26:33.450 
就我军威慑系统缺乏公信力激烈争论过
Made that big hassle about our deterrent lacking credibility.

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:38.590 
R计划的最初设想是一种报复性保卫措施
The idea was for plan R to be a sort of retaliatory safeguard.

4
00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:40.100 
保卫措施
A safeguard?

5
00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:44.050 
我承认 某些人为因素让该初衷发生了偏离

8
00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:52.130 
就能毁灭华盛顿和您...
As part of a general sneak attack...

9
00:26:52.130 --> 00:26:56.180 
并趁我方指挥和控制不当而逃脱反击
And escape retaliation because of lack of proper command and control.
