00:31:58.540 --> 00:32:00.150 
收音机开始不停地换台
the radio starts flipping stations.

2
00:32:00.150 --> 00:32:02.480 
就好像汽车自己有了灵魂一样
It was like the car had a mind of its own.

3
00:32:02.970 --> 00:32:04.160 
那么  你在切换的时候是不是睡着了
So, were you asleep at the switch?

4
00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:06.860 
打断一下  请不要几个人一起发问
Excuse me. One interrogator at a time, please.

5
00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:09.130 
-你到底是不是睡着了  -我没有睡着
- But were you asleep at the switch? - I was not asleep.

6
00:32:09.130 --> 00:32:10.900 
我并没有真正地睡着
I never actually fell asleep.

7
00:32:11.020 --> 00:32:12.710 
真正地睡着  好吧
Actually asleep? Okay, good.

8
00:32:12.710 --> 00:32:13.420 
那你就是在打瞌睡
Were you dozing?

9
00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:15.290 
那辆车应该自动行驶的
The car is supposed to drive itself.

10
00:32:15.290 --> 00:32:17.060 
-那你确实在打瞌睡  -也许是在你睡着的时候
- So you were dozing? - Maybe when you were asleep,

11
00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:18.990 
你不小心取消了自动行驶模式  然后
you accidentally disengaged the driverless mode, and...

12
00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:20.770 
反对  他已经说过他没有睡着了
Objection. He already said he wasn't sleeping.

13
00:32:20.770 --> 00:32:22.600 
不能用这样下套的方式来获得证词
This isn't deposition by ambush.

14
00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:24.580 
他要么一个个地回答我们的问题
He's either going to answer our questions

15
00:32:24.590 --> 00:32:27.330 
要么就一起全部回答完  随便他怎么选
one at a time or altogether. It's his choice.

16
00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:29.740 
那么你在切换的时候确实睡着了
So you were asleep at the switch?
