00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:08.830 
我们没有很长的时间 但是我很想  如果可能的话
We don't have very long, but what I'd like to do, in an ideal world...

2
00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.600 
接着写那首"爱情解剖"
...is continue the "Autopsy" song.

3
00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:13.570 
但是我担心要从这首歌改成
But I think it's gonna be very hard to get back from there...

4
00:27:13.740 --> 00:27:16.800 
科拉要的那首"重新找到爱" 可不是很容易
...into "Way Back Into Love," which is the title that Cora demands.

5
00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:20.750 
我们要做就是接着做格雷格的 那个"天使之死"
What we could do is continue with Greg "the Angel of Death's" version.

6
00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:22.280 
那是抄袭
That's plagiarism.

7
00:27:22.450 --> 00:27:24.540 
是吧  说的对  就是这样
Yes. Yes, yes. Good. Excellent.

8
00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:27.310 
我是不会剽窃别人的作品的
I would never in a million years use someone else's work.

9
00:27:27.490 --> 00:27:28.680 
很高兴你同意我的看法
I'm very glad you agree.

10
00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:34.450 
那么  我们需要什么呢 我们要作一首全新的曲子
So, what we need, we need something brand-new.

11
00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:38.970
