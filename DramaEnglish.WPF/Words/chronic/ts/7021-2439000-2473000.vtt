1
00:40:41.130 --> 00:40:42.940 
你能在法庭上证明什么
What can you prove at trial?

2
00:40:43.730 --> 00:40:46.450 
目前无法证明阿克斯罗德做了任何事
Nothing on Mr. Axelrod at this time.

3
00:40:46.460 --> 00:40:49.870 
东区检察院  我们撤诉
The Eastern District--we're dismissing the indictment.

4
00:40:54.850 --> 00:40:58.130 
肃静  肃静  肃静
Quiet! Quiet, quiet, quiet! Quiet!

5
00:40:58.540 --> 00:41:01.520 
你看  这就是为什么法官一职让人高兴
See, this is why life on the bench is so gratifying,

6
00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:03.380 
如我之前所说
as I was alluding to earlier.

7
00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:06.870 
两方拉锯  就像两人轮流击球的游戏一样
Whipsawed this way and that. Like a tetherball.

8
00:41:06.870 --> 00:41:09.000 
这还会一轮一轮继续下去
This will continue to go round and round.

9
00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:10.760 
即便我们撤诉  我们还会
Even as we withdraw, we will,

10
00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:12.680 
我依然会调查此案
I will, continue to investigate.

11
00:41:12.690 --> 00:41:14.690 
因为这一破坏确有发生
Because this sabotage did happen.
