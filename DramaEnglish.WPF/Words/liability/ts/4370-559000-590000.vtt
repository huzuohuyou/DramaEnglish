00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:24.680 
你那客户很古怪吗
Is your client erratic?

2
00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:27.000 
我的  怎么这么说
My... Why?

3
00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:29.290 
他说这个叫埃尔斯贝特的
He says this Elsbeth has, uh,

4
00:09:29.380 --> 00:09:30.920 
表现得有些古怪
been demonstrating some erratic behavior,

5
00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:32.290 
他们不得不先做个心理评估
and they have to do a psych evaluation

6
00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:33.960 
才能转送她
before they can transport her.

7
00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:35.760 
责任问题嘛
Liability.

8
00:09:35.850 --> 00:09:37.390 
许多事情我都可以搞定
Well, I can trump a lot of things,

9
00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:39.710 
防范措施什么的就不行了
but I can't trump insurance issues,

10
00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:43.130 
你就去告诉你客户让她把心理评估过了
so you tell your client to pass her psych eval

11
00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:44.600 
我再提她上来
and I'll get her up here.

12
00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:46.430 
几小时后我们应该可以把埃尔斯贝特弄出来
We think we can get Elsbeth out in a few hours,

13
00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:48.090 
但眼下这次听证只能我负责
but I'll have to take this for now.

14
00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:49.650 
他们就打算在这里举行听证吗
They're going to do the hearing here?

15
00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:50.840 
这是仲裁员在这么短的时间里
It's the only place the arbitrators could find
