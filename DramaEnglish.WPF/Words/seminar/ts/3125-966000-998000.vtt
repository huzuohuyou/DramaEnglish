00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:09.130 
我刚是想说明你的确有加重语气
I was trying to illustrate that you put quotes around it.

2
00:16:09.130 --> 00:16:11.820 
我累得要死  没力气加重语气
I am too tired to put quotes around things,

3
00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:13.690 
如果如果我要给某个词加重语气
but if I were gonna put quotes on a word,

4
00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:16.440 
那个词一定是"研讨会"
that word would be, "seminar"!

5
00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:18.210 
对了  还有"打造品牌"
Oh, and "branding"!

6
00:16:18.210 --> 00:16:21.390 
我会特意大大加重语气在
And I would put big, giant, dumbass quotes around

7
00:16:21.390 --> 00:16:23.540 
"打造品牌研讨会"这个词上
"branding seminar"!

8
00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:25.970 
麦克斯  你是故意的
Max, you did that on purpose!

9
00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:28.680 
或是这只是个意外
Oh, maybe it was just an accident!

10
00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:34.010 
住手  住手  你喷到电灯泡了
Stop! Stop! You're spraying the light cord!

11
00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:36.480 
喂  水和电"不是"
Hello! Water and electricity,

12
00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:39.050 
电死人的最佳组合吗
not the best combo!
