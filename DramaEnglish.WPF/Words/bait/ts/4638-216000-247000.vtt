00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:38.810 
天啊
Oh, dear.

2
00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.380 
说我盲目追求时髦
To which I'm so helplessly slavish.

3
00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.420 
误解我了
I have been ill-quoted.

4
00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:46.950 
她对荷叶边和十字绣的痴迷
her obsession with flounce and cross-stitch?

5
00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.280 
十字绣  布朗恩小姐
Cross- stitch? Miss Brawne,

6
00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.040 
我甚至不知它为何物
I don't even know what that means.

7
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.790 
请君入瓮
Baiting, baiting.

8
00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.260 
布朗先生  我也是这样看待您的诗
I feel the same about your poems, Mr. Brown.

9
00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.200 
我不知它们为何物
I know nothing of what they mean.

10
00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.830 
故弄玄虚  词不达意  读后让人反感
They puff smoke, dissolve, leaving nothing but irritation.

11
00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.500 
范妮  把这茶给济慈先生送去  他情绪很低落
Fanny, take this tea to Mr. Keats. He is in very poor spirits.

12
00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.000 
济慈先生在创作不想被打扰
Mr. Keats is composing and does not want disturbing.
