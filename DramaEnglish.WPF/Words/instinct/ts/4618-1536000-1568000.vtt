00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:41.720 
人们认得我们 不认得的 我们自报家门
people knew who we were and if they didn't they asked and we told them out names.

2
00:25:41.930 --> 00:25:46.180 
没错 可每个答案都似是而非 唯有靠直觉
We did the trouble is, each of them is plausible, without being instinctive.

3
00:25:51.850 --> 00:25:53.150 
直觉？
Instinctive?

4
00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:58.690 
你一辈子那么贴近真相，它成了你眼角一片永恒的迷雾……
All your life you live so close to truth, it becomes a permanent blur in the corner of your eye,

5
00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:03.160 
可一旦显出轮廓 它就中了荒诞的埋伏
and when something nudges it into outline it is like being ambushed by a grotesque.

6
00:26:03.450 --> 00:26:07.080 
一个骑手 半明半寐的早晨 擂窗板……
A man standing in his saddle in the half-lit, half-alive dawn banged in the shutters...

7
00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:11.720 
喊两个名字 我们就被他喊来了。这没错 我们来了
and called two names. And when he called we came. That much is certain, we came.
