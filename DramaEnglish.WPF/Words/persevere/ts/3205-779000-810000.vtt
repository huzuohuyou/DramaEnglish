他们知道自己会输

3
00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:06.160 
却还是上场比赛
but they went in there anyway,

4
00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:07.120 
打出他们最好的表现

00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:08.780 
最后取得了胜利  泰德

这就是他们唯一获胜的原因

因为计分出错  还是敌方的卡里·尼尔还身患感冒

11
00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:21.180 
只要赢一次就好
Just one win.

12
00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:24.180
