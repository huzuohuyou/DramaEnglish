00:02:45.666 --> 00:02:48.502 
好吧，现在你想问我什么？
OKAY, NOW WHAT DID YOU WANT TO ASK ME?

2
00:02:48.536 --> 00:02:50.238 
我想知道--
I WAS WONDERING IF--

3
00:02:50.271 --> 00:02:53.507 
-很尴尬。-这是个简单的问题。
- IT WAS EMBARRASSING. - IT WAS A SIMPLE QUESTION.

4
00:02:53.541 --> 00:02:56.244 
你父亲在两条过道外对我喊叫，
YOUR FATHER SHOUTS AT ME FROM TWO AISLES AWAY,

5
00:02:56.277 --> 00:02:58.479 
“嘿，艾姆斯，你喜欢哪种厕纸--
"HEY, AMES, WHAT KIND OF TOILET PAPER YOU LIKE--

6
00:02:58.512 --> 00:03:00.514 
绗缝的还是超级绗缝的？”
QUILTED OR SUPER-QUILTED?"

7
00:03:01.582 --> 00:03:03.617 
嘿，看，斯宾塞来了。
HEY, LOOK, SPENCER'S HERE.

8
00:03:05.253 --> 00:03:07.288 
那又怎样，全世界都不知道
SO WHAT, THE WORLD DOESN'T KNOW

9
00:03:07.321 --> 00:03:10.491 
伟大的艾米邓肯用厕纸？
THAT THE GREAT AMY DUNCAN USES TOILET PAPER?

10
00:03:10.524 --> 00:03:12.960 
很高兴见到你们，邓肯夫妇。
NICE TO SEE YOU, MR. AND MRS. DUNCAN.

11
00:03:12.993 --> 00:03:16.730 
大喊大叫之后，你就错了。
AFTER ALL THAT SHOUTING, YOU GOT THE WRONG KIND.
