1
00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:41.280 
我们会分析消灭行动目标的
We take into account the strategic value

2
00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:42.640 
战略价值
of eliminating a target,

3
00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:44.440 
以及潜在的对平民
the potential damage to civilians,

4
00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:47.390 
领近的寺院  学校  医院的附带损害
and the proximity to mosques, schools, or hospitals.

5
00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:49.220 
这些数据会全部输入电脑进行计算
This is all entered into a computer algorithm,

6
00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:51.050 
再据此确定是否进行攻击
which determines the worthiness of an attack.

7
00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:52.560 
所以有一部分的平民伤亡
So there are some deaths of civilians

8
00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:53.540 
是被允许的
that are deemed appropriate.

9
00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:55.250 
遗憾地说是这样  有时候杀死基地组织
Unfortunately, yes, sometimes the value of killing

10
00:18:55.250 --> 00:18:58.110 
目标比少许平民伤亡更重要
an al-Qaeda target outweighs killing civilians.

11
00:18:58.110 --> 00:18:58.960 
在打击基地组织成员
That was the case

12
00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:01.910 
达萨里的时候就是这种情况吗
with the al-Qaeda operative, Amad al Dasari?

13
00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:04.280 
被告辩称这些行动中也存在平民伤亡
The defense has argued that someone should have been arrested

14
00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:06.030 
于是也应该有人对此承担责任
in that attack because civilians were killed.

15
00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:08.300 
不是这样的  那些行动是被批准的
No, that attack was sanctioned.
