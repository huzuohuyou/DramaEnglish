00:00:30.153 --> 00:00:32.588 
它们由巨大的石头，
with those massive stones,

2
00:00:32.612 --> 00:00:36.737 
以复杂、似乎没有逻辑的形式堆叠而成。
assembled in complex but seemingly illogical ways,

3
00:00:38.112 --> 00:00:41.754 
而它们所有的建造痕迹
and all traces of their construction

4
00:00:41.778 --> 00:00:43.421 
都被抹去了，
erased,

5
00:00:43.445 --> 00:00:45.487 
让它们成为了人类历史的不解之谜。
shrouding them in mystery.

6
00:00:47.237 --> 00:00:50.945 
很难想象人类能够建造这些奇迹，
It seems like people could not have possibly built these things,

7
00:00:52.403 --> 00:00:53.695 
因为它们不是人类建造的，
because people didn't.

8
00:00:54.612 --> 00:00:58.921 
是一群原始巨人精心打磨成的，
They were carefully crafted by a primordial race of giants
