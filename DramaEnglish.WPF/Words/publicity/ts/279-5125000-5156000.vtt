01:25:25.053 --> 01:25:27.290 
One more kissing the bride, huh, Mr. Gehrig?

2
01:25:27.423 --> 01:25:28.424 
OK.

3
01:25:28.557 --> 01:25:29.258 
Oh, that's terrific.

4
01:25:29.392 --> 01:25:31.460 
Hold it.

5
01:25:31.594 --> 01:25:33.061 
Thank you, Mr. Gehrig.

6
01:25:33.162 --> 01:25:36.965 
Now, what about the one where the bride kisses the groom?

7
01:25:37.065 --> 01:25:38.667 
I never know you were such a hound

8
01:25:38.801 --> 01:25:40.102 
for publicity, Mr. Gehrig.

9
01:25:40.236 --> 01:25:41.604 
Publicity?

10
01:25:41.737 --> 01:25:43.272 
I don't even care if there's no film in their cameras.

11
01:25:43.406 --> 01:25:45.073 
All right, here we go.

12
01:25:45.174 --> 01:25:45.908 
Hold it.

13
01:25:46.008 --> 01:25:47.243 
Hold it.

14
01:25:47.343 --> 01:25:48.777 
OK.

15
01:25:48.911 --> 01:25:50.913 
A girl's gotta breathe.

16
01:25:50.979 --> 01:25:53.081 
Well, best of luck to you, Lou.

17
01:25:53.182 --> 01:25:54.183 
Thanks, Babe.

18
01:25:54.317 --> 01:25:55.618 
You'll get a great play on these pictures, boys,

19
01:25:55.751 --> 01:25:57.186 
taken the day that Lou won all three
