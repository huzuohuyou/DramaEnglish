1
00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:14.370 
是啊
Yeah, you're right.

2
00:09:14.470 --> 00:09:15.920 
我们急诊室的人不过就是在救命
In ER, we're only saving lives.

3
00:09:16.010 --> 00:09:17.800 
捞不到名声 没有
There's no fame, there's no, uh,

4
00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:19.550 
CNN来采访
-CNN interviews. -(LAUGHS DRYLY)

5
00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:21.500 
那我只能继续用尼克了
I guess I'll just have to stick with Nic.

6
00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:22.630 
等等
Whoa, wait a minute.

7
00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:23.960 
你们不是...你俩没...
You're not... You guys aren't...

8
00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:25.300 
什么
What?

9
00:09:25.390 --> 00:09:28.140 
上床吧 抱歉 我以为我厌恶的口气能暗示我的意思了
Sleeping together? Sorry, I thought that was implicit in my disgust.

10
00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:29.770 
其实非常明显
Explicit, actually.

11
00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:32.100 
没有 我有绝对不能跟同事约会的规矩
No, I have a very strict rule against dating colleagues.

12
00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:33.180 
是吗
Oh, really?

13
00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:34.360 
我称之为"斯特兰奇准则"
I call it the "Strange Policy."

14
00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:36.980 
太棒了 很高兴有东西是以我命名的
Oh, well, good, I'm glad something's named after me.

15
00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:39.400 
我发明了一种椎板切除术手术
I invented a Iaminectomy procedure.

16
00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:42.190 
似乎没人愿意管它叫斯特兰奇术
And yet, somehow no one seems to want to call it the "Strange Technique."

17
00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:43.900 
是我们一起发明了那个术式
We invented that technique.
