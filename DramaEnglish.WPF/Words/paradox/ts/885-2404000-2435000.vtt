1
00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:06.670 
这样你就能造出闭合的循环
That lets you create closed loops,

2
00:40:06.690 --> 00:40:11.010 
好比彭罗斯阶梯 无止尽的阶梯
like the Penrose steps, the infinite staircases.

3
00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:15.930 
看见了吗
See?

4
00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:20.810 
矛盾建筑
Paradox.

5
00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:22.890 
这样的闭合循环
So a closed loop like that will help you

6
00:40:22.890 --> 00:40:25.300 
有助你分辨梦境的边缘
disguise the boundaries of the dream you create.

7
00:40:25.310 --> 00:40:27.860 
梦境的每一层需要多大
But how big do these levels have to be?

8
00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:31.210 
随你 一个楼面一幢大楼或是一座城市
It could be anything from the floor of a building to an entire city.

9
00:40:31.210 --> 00:40:32.620 
但梦境必须非常复杂
But they have to be complicated

10
00:40:32.620 --> 00:40:34.700 
能让我们躲避映射的追踪
enough that we can hide from the projections.

11
00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:35.720 
比如一个迷宫吗
A maze?
