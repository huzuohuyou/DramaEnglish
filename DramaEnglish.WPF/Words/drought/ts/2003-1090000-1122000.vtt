我们照做了  它们再也不会回来了
Oh we got rid of 'em, all right. They're never coming back.

00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:19.590 
你们两个简直绝了  到底为什么要叫我过来
You two are impossible. Why did you even call me here?

因为你是卡洛琳公主  你什么都能处理
Because you're Princess Carolyn, you can fix anything.

00:18:22.010 --> 00:18:25.010 
这倒是  但是你们不能在自家草坪上点火啊

00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:37.170 
这个办法能行  我得打几个电话
This could work. I got to make a few phone calls.

谢谢  你最棒了
Thanks. You're the best.

00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:41.240 
我跟你说  我得想想办法
I tell you, I've got half a mind to go over

12
00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:44.200 
好好教训一下臭鼬那个罪魁祸首
and give it to that skunk for starting this whole darn thing.
