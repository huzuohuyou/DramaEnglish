- 我告诉过你南瓜的是吗？ - 没
- I told you about the pumpkin, didn't I? - No.

2
00:16:09.053 --> 00:16:11.544 
万圣节我给她买了的这个巨大的南瓜。
I bought her this huge pumpkin for Halloween.

3
00:16:11.639 --> 00:16:13.845 
她不忍心在上面雕刻所以把南瓜藏起来了。
She couldn't bear to carve it so she saved it.

4
00:16:13.933 --> 00:16:15.641 
直到圣诞节。
It ended up under the Christmas tree.

5
00:16:15.726 --> 00:16:19.142 
然后格拉默说，在平安夜闻到了令人作呕的气味......
Then Gramoo said on Christmas Eve there was this sickening smell...

6
00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:21.057 
......渗透到整个房子里。 - 不是吧
...permeating the entire house. - No.

7
00:16:21.148 --> 00:16:24.766 
当我把它捡起来，它的爆炸了，液体在同一时间喷出来。
When I picked it up, it sort of exploded and liquefied at the same time.

8
00:16:25.569 --> 00:16:28.404 
这不好笑。 它浸透了格拉默东面的地板。
It wasn't funny. It soaked through Gramoo's Oriental.

9
00:16:28.489 --> 00:16:30.944 
现在地板上仍然有一个大的斑点。
There's still a big spot on the floor.

10
00:16:34.119 --> 00:16:37.120 
好吧。我们需要些墙纸。 嘿，希斯。
Okay. We need wallpaper paste. Hey, Cece.
