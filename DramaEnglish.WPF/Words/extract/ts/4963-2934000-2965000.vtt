她这30年来

6
00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:05.520 
都在量子域吸收量子能

我们可以提取那能量

00:49:06.860 --> 00:49:09.340 
用它来修复艾娃的分子结构

那会把珍妮特撕裂的

等珍妮特的位置出现在朗脑子里
When Janet's location pops into Lang's head,

15

他就得告诉我
he's gonna give it to me

16
00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:21.250 
否则我就把他交给联调局

00:49:21.250 --> 00:49:22.160 
什么
What?

18
