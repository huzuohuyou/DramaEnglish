00:14:29.450 --> 00:14:30.360 
手袋
Handbag!

2
00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:34.390 
站住  等等  你的生命不只属于你
Stop! Wait! Your life is not your own!

3
00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:36.260 
别乱动它  明白吗
Keep your hands off it, do you hear me?

4
00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:38.920 
别动它  别动它
Off it. Off it.

5
00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:42.300 
不好意思  什么  你在说什么
Sorry? What? What are you talking about?

6
00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:44.190 
-你的裙子  -我的裙子
- Your skirt. - My skirt?

7
00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:45.930 
看看边角  我就是这么发现的
Look at the hem of it, that's what I noticed.

8
00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:49.130 
抱歉  我还在努力跟上我的脑子  它太快了
Sorry, I'm still catching up with my brain. It's terribly fast.

9
00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:51.290 
那些印记  你看到了吗
Those markings, you see them?

10
00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:52.960 
裙子被车门夹住时
You only get marks like that

11
00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:54.480 
才会留下那样的印记
by trapping the hem of your skirt in a car door,

12
00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:55.550 
但印记在你的左边
but they're on the left-hand side,

13
00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:57.680 
所以你没有开车  你坐在副驾上
so you weren't driving, you were in the passenger seat.

14
00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:58.960 
我坐出租车来的
I came in a taxi.

15
00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:00.880 
门外的街上并没有出租车在等
There is no taxi waiting in the street outside,
