2
00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:47.760 
你是唯一一个多少还在维护他的人
You're the only thing that stands between him and an ax in the head.

恐惧可不是有效的动力

00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:56.230 
我眼下只对他能活多久感兴趣
For now, I'm simply interested in time frame.

6
00:30:56.260 --> 00:30:58.600 
他不会死的太快吧
He will live for the foreseeable future, yes?

00:30:58.630 --> 00:31:00.570 
没错
Mm, foreseeable,

00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:01.600 
至少有几年吧
couple years at least,

9

不考虑天灾人祸的话
barring acts of God and men with axes.

10
00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:07.640 
律师告诉我
Oh, from the lawyer,

11
00:31:07.670 --> 00:31:09.140 
应该让你知道
I'm supposed to let you know

12
00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:11.780 
平克曼小子正找机会出手呢
the Pinkman kid is looking to sell.

13
00:31:11.810 --> 00:31:13.610 
我不跟嗑药的搅在一起
I don't work with junkies.

14
00:31:13.650 --> 00:31:15.550 
想你也会这么说
That's what I thought you'd say.
