00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:37.320 
策划了一场无效审判
By engineering a mistrial.

2
00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:38.210 
开玩笑吧
Seriously?

3
00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:41.430 
我很抱歉  什么
I'm sorry, what?

4
00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:43.520 
我说「开玩笑吧」
I said, "Seriously?"

5
00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:46.260 
这也太简单了吧
It just seems pretty convenient,

6
00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.890 
福瑞克就这么应承了你要他做的事
Florrick admitting exactly what you need him to.

7
00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:50.550 
加伯先生所说的证词
Mr. Garber is giving

8
00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:51.750 
可是宣过誓的
sworn testimony.

9
00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:52.990 
宣誓是宣誓了
That he practiced.

10
00:08:52.990 --> 00:08:55.740 
但还得看他是否把其他事也记得如此清楚
But see if he remembers anything else that clearly.

11
00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:58.160 
上周二的午饭你吃了什么
What did you have for lunch last Tuesday?

12
00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:00.260 
你不必回答这个问题  加伯先生
Uh, you-you don't have to answer that, Mr. Garber.

13
00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.190 
你说过我们想问什么都行
You said we could ask anything we want.

14
00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:03.960 
没错  任何相关的问题  先生
Yes. Anything relevant, sir.

15
00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:05.290 
为何这个问题就不相关
Why isn't this relevant?

16
00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:07.170 
我们全都在听你的提问
We've been listening to all your questioning.
