1
00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.560 
试过了  但他们说我向公司撒了谎
Yes, but they said I lied to the company,

2
00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:38.890 
所以他们可以开除我
so they could fire me.

3
00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.290 
所以我才要起诉
That's why I'm suing.

4
00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.340 
硅谷是个小地方
Silicon Valley's a very provincial town.

5
00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.690 
出了这事我就找不到工作了
I can't get a job anywhere.

6
00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.870 
《雇员测谎保护法》
Well, The Polygraph Protection Act

7
00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.540 
可以保护雇员  避免他们被强制测谎
keeps an employer from forcing you to take a lie detector test,

8
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.180 
但也有例外
but there are exceptions.

9
00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.970 
比如涉及偷窃时
Theft.

10
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.450 
克里斯汀  这是我们的调查员  杰森
Uh, Kristen, this is our investigator Jason.

11
00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.950 
你好  但我没偷东西啊
Hi. But I didn't steal anything.

12
00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.340 
是的  但这是公司进行测谎的原因
Yes, but it was the reason for the polygraph.

13
00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.070 
他们发现你撒了别的谎  但是...
They caught you in another lie, but...

14
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.350 
他们需要确凿的证据
They need corroborating evidence.

15
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:04.690 
的确
Right.

16
00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:05.980 
除非他们已经掌握了相关证据
And they couldn't have fired her
