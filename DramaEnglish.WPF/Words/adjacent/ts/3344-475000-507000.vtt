00:07:57.570 --> 00:07:59.840 
可你俩未必是天赐良缘
but some things just aren't meant to be.

2
00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:01.010 
先别急着下定论
Not so fast.

3
00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:03.170 
那晚接近尾声的时候  我靠过去
At the end of the night,when I leaned in

4
00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:05.740 
虽然结果只亲着她眼珠子
and somehow accidentally kissed her open eyeball,

5
00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:07.810 
我却发现有火光小闪
there was a slight flicker of something

6
00:08:07.810 --> 00:08:10.710 
这就是所谓的爱火吧
I might even call chemistry...

7
00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:12.420 
类似爱情
adjacent.

8
00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.450 
谢谢
Thank you.

9
00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:15.990 
等等
Wait.

10
00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:19.020 
我的钱呢
Where is my cash?

11
00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:20.720 
这不是嘛
Oh, yeah,

12
00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:23.490 
我帮你换了点零钱  加国人
I did a little exchange for ya, Canucklehead.

13
00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:26.900 
这种加拿大钱币呢  叫"卢尼"
This Canadian dollar here is called a "loonie."

14
00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:31.200 
这个两元的硬币呢  叫"突尼"  没骗你哦
And this two-dollar coin? A "toonie." True story.
