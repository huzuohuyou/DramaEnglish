00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:17.670 
威尔逊好不好
Wilson, maybe.

2
00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:22.460 
还是算了  先喝一杯吧
No. You should have a drink.

3
00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:24.360 
我工作的时候不喝酒
I don't drink when I'm working.

4
00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.430 
是吗  那现在起改改吧
No? Well, start.

5
00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:29.100 
你们这些一级的小哥都一个样
You tier one boys are all the same--

6
00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:30.440 
紧张过头
Tense.

7
00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:32.950 
而在现实中  这会害死我们
Out here, "Tense" gets us killed.

8
00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:35.030 
你以前深入敌后
In your old job, you were behind enemy lines

9
00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:38.310 
半年  最多一年吧
for 6, 12 months?

10
00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:41.280 
但这个工作  你没有退路
In this job, you never go back,

11
00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:44.310 
因为这里没有敌前敌后这一说
Because there is no line to cross back over.

12
00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:47.350 
敌人永远都在  明白吗
Never was. Understand?
