00:13:58.570 --> 00:13:59.950 
你要如何平定他们
who don't want to be pacified?

2
00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:02.760 
但我想我们可以弄些铁丝网
But I guess we'll string some concertina wire,

3
00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:04.410 
将那些越共匪徒拒之门外
try to keep out the VC riffraff

4
00:14:04.410 --> 00:14:06.610 
还可以在情况危急时
and then provide a little old-fashioned American

5
00:14:06.610 --> 00:14:08.590 
拿些老式美制军火出来
firepower when it hits the fan,

6
00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:10.560 
这种情况肯定迟早会有的
which most definitely will happen.

7
00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:13.610 
夜晚的时候  擦亮双眼
At night, you watch.

8
00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.580 
来来去去的人影
Shadows come, shadows go.

9
00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:17.710 
对方到底是敌是友
Are they against us? Are they with us?

10
00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:19.200 
无从得知  也无所谓
Don't know, don't care.

11
00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:22.250 
他们把铁丝网剪掉  第二天你再去修好
They cut the wire, next day you repair the wire.

12
00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:23.340 
日复一日
Rinse and repeat.

13
00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:27.930 
我每隔几天会来看看你
I'll be checking in on you every couple days.

14
00:14:28.730 --> 00:14:30.260 
这是个轻松的活
This is a cush detail
