我并不想把你当做下人

2
00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:10.350 
但你却命令我跟你说话
Yet you'd command me to speak?

3
00:44:11.060 --> 00:44:12.890 
我命令的口吻伤了你的自尊吗
Are you very hurt by my tone of command?

4
00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:14.980 
很少有主人会去关心
There are few masters who'd trouble to enquire

5
00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:16.610 
自己的言语是否中伤了

Well, on that mercenary ground,

10
00:44:24.870 --> 00:44:26.870 
你是否愿意与我平等地谈话
will you consent to speak as my equal

11
00:44:26.950 --> 00:44:29.290 
而不把它当做是傲慢无礼的要求呢
without thinking that the request arises from insolence?

12
00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:32.580 
我绝不会把不拘礼节错当傲慢无理  先生
I'd never mistake informality for insolence, sir.
