01:31:47.890 --> 01:31:52.210 
无镶框的脸倚靠在寂然的墙上
Frameless heads on nameless walls

2
01:31:52.210 --> 01:31:55.950 
配上一双看遍世事且永不遗忘的双眼
With eyes that watch the world and can't forget

3
01:31:55.950 --> 01:32:01.640 
就像你曾遇见的陌生人
Like the stranger that you've met

4
01:32:01.640 --> 01:32:07.180 
那些衣杉褴褛的人们
The ragged men in ragged clothes

5
01:32:07.180 --> 01:32:11.020 
像血红的玫瑰上的银色的刺
The silver thorn of bloddy rose

6
01:32:11.020 --> 01:32:18.500 
断裂并静卧在初下的雪上
Lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow

7
01:32:18.500 --> 01:32:24.560 
我想我已明白
Now I think I know
