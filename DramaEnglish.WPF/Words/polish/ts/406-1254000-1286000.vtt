1
00:20:57.297 --> 00:20:59.507 
她嫁给伯爵后
It's odd she should've kept such an ugly name as Ellen

2
00:20:59.591 --> 00:21:01.425 
还是没改掉艾伦这个俗气的名字
when she married the Count.

3
00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:03.344 
换成是我  我就改成伊莲
I should have changed it to Elaine.

4
00:21:04.179 --> 00:21:05.513 
为什么
Why?

5
00:21:06.556 --> 00:21:08.120 
我也不知道
I don't know.

6
00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:09.860 
这样听起来
It sounds more

7
00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:11.410 
有波兰味
Polish.

8
00:21:13.272 --> 00:21:15.147 
那反而会太特别
It certainly sounds more conspicuous,

9
00:21:15.232 --> 00:21:17.024 
她不会要的
and that can hardly be what she wishes.

10
00:21:17.109 --> 00:21:20.236 
如果她选择特别  又有何不可
Why not? Why shouldn't she be conspicuous if she chooses?

11
00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:23.781 
她是嫁错人  但用不着隐姓埋名
She made an awful marriage. But should she hide her head as if it's her fault?

12
00:21:23.865 --> 00:21:26.701 
难道她就该见不得人  好像让自己丢了脸
Should she go slinking around as if she disgraced herself?
