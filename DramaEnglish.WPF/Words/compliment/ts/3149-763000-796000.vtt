You must've chatted women up before.

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:46.850 
那你肯定有跟女人搭过话吧

00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:51.170

00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:51.170

00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:52.140 
"Come on Basil, how about it?" kind of thing.

00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:52.140 
诸如此类的挑起话头

7
00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:54.700 
Then we break up shortly afterwards.

00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:54.700 
然后我们就草草终止对话了

9
00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:56.770

00:12:56.770 --> 00:12:58.220

15
00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:02.970 
can I come in for a glass of water?

16
00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:02.970 
我能进来喝杯水吗

00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:06.770 
What if Spiros comes home?

20
00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:06.770 
要是斯皮罗回家了呢

21
00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:08.470 
He won't, he's at our house all the hours

22
00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:08.470 
不会的 他会一直待在我家

23
00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:10.600 
and he said his kids are away with their granny.

24
00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:10.600 
而且他说他的孩子去奶奶家了

25
00:13:12.420 --> 00:13:15.000 
She's lonely, look.
