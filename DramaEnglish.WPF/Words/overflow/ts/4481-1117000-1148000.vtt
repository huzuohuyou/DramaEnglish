00:18:37.770 --> 00:18:39.880 
-继续  -好了
- Carry on. - Yes.

2
00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:41.750 
既然大家都跟上进度了
Well, now that we're all up to speed,

3
00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:43.580 
我想谈谈艾丽西娅
uh, I want to discuss Alicia.

4
00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:46.640 
我觉得我们该和她和解
I think we should turn the temperature down with her.

5
00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:47.850 
你想邀请她回来吗
Do you want to invite her back?

6
00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:49.730 
这么做  我们就会失去里斯·迪普尔的业务
We do that, we lose Reese Dipple's business.

7
00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:50.890 
大卫说得对
I'm afraid David's right,

8
00:18:50.890 --> 00:18:52.550 
但可以给她我们多出来的
but we could feed her our overflow.

9
00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:53.180 
多出来的
Overflow?

10
00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:54.490 
你是说多出来的案子吗
You mean overflow cases?

11
00:18:54.490 --> 00:18:56.700 
没错  这对我们不造成经济冲击
Yes, it's financially negligible to us,

12
00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:57.590 
但能帮到她
but it could help her.

13
00:18:57.590 --> 00:19:00.290 
也能避免她成为坎宁的潜在帮手
It could also help neutralize her as a potential pawn for Canning.

14
00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:02.180 
而做我们的人
She'll be our pawn instead.

15
00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:05.080 
霍华德
Howard?

16
00:19:05.090 --> 00:19:07.840 
我在看都有谁在
I'm checking to see who's here.
