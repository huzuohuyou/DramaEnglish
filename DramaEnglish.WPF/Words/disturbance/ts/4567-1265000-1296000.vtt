00:21:06.974 --> 00:21:09.010 
Now, I want you to think very carefully

2
00:21:09.101 --> 00:21:10.591 
before you answer this.

3
00:21:10.686 --> 00:21:12.642 
Each time you stole something,

4
00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:14.721 
do you remember how you felt afterwards?

5
00:21:14.815 --> 00:21:16.021 
Guilty?

6
00:21:16.817 --> 00:21:18.148 
Upset?

7
00:21:18.235 --> 00:21:20.146 
Depressed.

8
00:21:20.237 --> 00:21:21.568 
Disturbed.

9
00:21:22.156 --> 00:21:23.771 
Cheerful.

10
00:21:23.866 --> 00:21:25.481 
How can you feel cheerful?

11
00:21:26.076 --> 00:21:28.283 
Gregory, that's why I'm here.

12
00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:31.282 
To try to find out why stealing makes me cheerful.

13
00:21:31.373 --> 00:21:33.659 
You couldn't. You couldn't possibly feel cheerful.
