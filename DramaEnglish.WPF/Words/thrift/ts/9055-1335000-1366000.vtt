00:22:15.730 --> 00:22:17.740 
可是你到艾尔西诺来有什么事
But what is your affair in Elsinore?

2
00:22:18.490 --> 00:22:21.290 
趁你未去之前  我们要陪你痛饮几杯哩
We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.

00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:24.160 
殿下  我是来参加您的父王的葬礼的
My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.

4

5
00:22:26.010 --> 00:22:27.970

这是一举两便的办法  霍拉旭
Thrift, thrift, Horatio!

00:22:31.970 --> 00:22:35.850 
葬礼中剩下来的残羹冷炙  正好宴请婚筵上的宾客
The funeral bak'd meats did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.

9
00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:38.640 
霍拉旭  我宁愿在天上遇见我的最痛恨的仇人
Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven,

10
00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:40.870 
也不愿看到那样的一天
or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!

00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:45.090 
我的父亲
My father...
