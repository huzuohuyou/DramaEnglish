00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:19.430 
将切实帮助我们评估自己的表现
what they think we did right and wrong,

2
00:12:19.430 --> 00:12:20.340 
所以  要是你不介意谈的话...
so if you don't mind talking...

3
00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:21.370 
我觉得我不该这么做
I don't think I'm supposed to.

4
00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:23.060 
没关系  只在审判过程中不能谈论
Oh, no, that's just during the trial.

5
00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:25.500 
在裁决之后  你有权说任何想说的话
You have the right to say anything you want after the verdict.

6
00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:29.890 
-这事还没完  -怎么了
- This isn't over. - What's now?

7
00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:31.280 
他们在外面找陪审员谈话
They're out talking to jurors.

8
00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:32.650 
他们想要翻案
They're going for a reversal.

9
00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:34.920 
或是径为判决
Or judgment notwithstanding.

10
00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:37.300 
-现在有点晚了  -我知道
- It's just kind of late. - I understand.

11
00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:38.290 
那我能要你的电话号码吗
Why don't I just take your number

12
00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:39.230 
然后明天打电话给你
and I'll call you tomorrow?

13
00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:40.360 
10分钟就够了
Ten minutes tops.

14
00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:42.210 
你不必和她谈的
You don't have to talk to her.

15
00:12:42.210 --> 00:12:44.500 
他拥有自己的权利  凯里
He's well within his rights, Cary.

16
00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:45.660 
我和他解释过了
I explained to him.

17
00:12:45.660 --> 00:12:46.990 
我知道  但你有解释过
Yes, but have you explained

18
00:12:46.990 --> 00:12:49.100 
他根本就不必和你进行交谈吗
that he don't have to talk to you at all?
