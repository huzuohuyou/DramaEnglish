00:09:00.445 --> 00:09:04.064 
创建了一套有着三级排名 的排名系统，
and created a three-tiered ranking system,

00:09:04.088 --> 00:09:06.623 
每个季度，
whereby every quarter,

6
00:09:06.647 --> 00:09:09.552 
如果某个地区的绩效下降了，
if a district's performance were to decline,

7
00:09:09.576 --> 00:09:12.376 
那就将其排名降低。
you could get relegated to the lower tier.

8
00:09:12.758 --> 00:09:15.619 
而如果一个地区的绩效上升了，
But if the district's performance were to improve,

9
00:09:15.643 --> 00:09:18.683 
就将其提升至最高档。
you could get promoted to the premiere league.

10
00:09:19.358 --> 00:09:21.491 
这套排名系统大获成功。
