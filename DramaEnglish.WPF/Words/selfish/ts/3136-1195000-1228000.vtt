00:19:56.250 --> 00:19:59.090 
有一次我不得不撬开后备箱逃走
I once had to chew my way out of the trunk of a car.

2
00:19:59.090 --> 00:20:00.580 
你以为你有麻烦了
You think you've got problems?

3
00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:02.680 
我的麻烦多到数不清  斯坦福
I've got a mullet, Stanford.

4
00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:04.650 
与此同时  你又在哪里呢
Meanwhile, where have you been?

5
00:20:04.650 --> 00:20:07.180 
你在树林中漂亮的小屋里快活
Living it up in your fancy house in the woods,

6
00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:08.960 
自私地屯着你大学的学费
selfishly hoarding your college money,

7
00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:10.770 
因为你只在乎你自己
because you only care about yourself.

8
00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:13.100 
我自私吗  我自私吗
I'm selfish? I'm selfish?

9
00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:14.670 
斯坦利  你怎么能这么说
Stanley, how can you say that

10
00:20:14.670 --> 00:20:16.780 
是你让我梦想中的大学化作泡影
after costing me my dream school?

11
00:20:16.780 --> 00:20:20.160 
我在给你机会  让你做一件你生命中最有价值的事情
I'm giving you a chance to do the first worthwhile thing in your life,

12
00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:21.200 
可你连听都不听
and you won't even listen.

13
00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:22.450 
那你听我说
Well, listen to this.

14
00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:24.090 
你想让我丢掉这本书
You want me to get rid of this book?

15
00:20:24.090 --> 00:20:26.120 
好啊  我现在就让它彻底不见
Fine, I'll get rid of it right now.

16
00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:27.460 
不  你不明白
No! You don't understand.

17
00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:28.690 
你说你想让我保管它
You said you wanted me to have it,
