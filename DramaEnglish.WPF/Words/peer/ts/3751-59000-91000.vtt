医学中心

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:04.880 
这是我见过最好的甲床吗
Are these my favorite nail beds I've ever seen?

3
00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:06.460 
不是  但它们还算健康
No, but they're fine.

4
00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.550 
好吧  我其实没打算来这里
Okay. You know, I-- I wasn't actually gonna come here.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:11.520 
但接着我突然想到
But then, I thought, "You know what?

6
00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:12.900 
我想散散步

我散步的时候思路更清晰
and well, I-- I think better when I walk.

10
00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.720 
如果我一边散步一边思考
If I'm gonna be thinking and walking,

11
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.100 
也许我会走到某个特定的地方
I might as well walk somewhere specific.

12
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.050 
你上次睡觉是什么时候
Hey, when was the last time you slept?

13
00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:27.370 
我不知道
Um... I don't know.

14
00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.830 
我昨晚本来想睡的
Well, I know I-- I was gonna sleep last night,

15
00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.470 
我以为我找到了
