00:05:18.528 --> 00:05:20.796 
也就是所谓的混沌反应。
what's called a chaotic response,

2
00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:23.963 
我们会感到沮丧、绝望、
which looks like depression, despair,

3
00:05:23.987 --> 00:05:25.588 
有种停摆了的感觉。
kind of a shutting down.

4
00:05:25.612 --> 00:05:30.088 
在容忍范围的另一边 则是一种更僵化的反应：
And on the other side of this window is a more rigid response:

5
00:05:30.112 --> 00:05:31.546 
否认，
denial,

6
00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:32.921 
愤怒，
anger,

7
00:05:32.945 --> 00:05:34.320 
僵化。
rigid.

8
00:05:34.945 --> 00:05:36.421 
所以当这种情况发生时，
And so when that happens,

9
00:05:36.445 --> 00:05:39.129 
我们实际上失去了情绪整合、
we actually lose our capacity to be integrated,

10
00:05:39.153 --> 00:05:40.504 
韧性、适应力，
resilient, adaptive,

11
00:05:40.528 --> 00:05:43.504 
以及所有我们想要的情绪控制力。
all those things that we want to be.

12
00:05:43.528 --> 00:05:44.879 
这很正常，
And this is totally normal,

13
00:05:44.903 --> 00:05:48.921 
但也在全世界发生着，不是吗？
but it's happening all around the world right now, right?

14
00:05:48.945 --> 00:05:52.963 
我们都在这些不同的感受 和情绪之间摇摆不定。
We're all vacillating between these different feelings and emotions.
