00:19:54.101 --> 00:19:56.103 
妈妈，我们今天要做什么？
Mother, what we going to do today?

2
00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:58.898 
我要带你到草地上去
I'm going to take you to the meadow.

3
00:19:59.023 --> 00:20:02.192 
草地？ 草地是什么呀？
Meadow? What's the meadow?

4
00:20:02.401 --> 00:20:05.946 
草地呀，是一个很好玩的地方

5
00:20:03.277 --> 00:20:06.154 
It's a very wonderful place.

6
00:20:06.113 --> 00:20:08.198 
那为什么我们以前都没去呢？

7
00:20:06.238 --> 00:20:09.074 
Then why haven't we been there before?

8
00:20:08.324 --> 00:20:11.577 
因为那个时候你年纪还小啊

9
00:20:09.158 --> 00:20:11.785 
You weren't big enough.

10
00:20:11.744 --> 00:20:13.787 
妈妈，你知道为什么吗？
-Mother, you know what?

11
00:20:13.954 --> 00:20:15.205 
什么？
-What?

12
00:20:14.663 --> 00:20:17.749 
We're not the only deer in the forest.

13
00:20:15.331 --> 00:20:17.166 
我们不是在这里唯一的鹿
