你今晚就可以进入纽约

不过我们必须确定你有"可靠的恐惧"

4
00:45:09.170 --> 00:45:10.840 
-恐惧 -恐惧
- Fear? - Mm- hm, fear.

5
00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:12.420 
-恐惧 -恐惧
- Fear. - Fear.

00:45:12.510 --> 00:45:14.720 
恐惧什么

你问到点子上了
That's the best part.

如果你能给我正确的答案
if you give me the correct answer,

11
00:45:26.220 --> 00:45:28.190 
我今晚就能让你离开机场
I can get you out of this airport tonight.
