00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:59.160 
只有我们对你发出极大量的光子
Only when we send all of those photons your way

2
00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:01.230 
比如说数千万个
tens of millions of them

3
00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:04.460 
现实才会开始成形
does reality begin to take shape.

4
00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:09.330 
久而久之概率变成可能性
Over time  probabilities become likelihoods and eventually

5
00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:13.160 
最后可能性变成必然性
likelihoods become certainties.

6
00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:16.660 
但是真有必然性这种东西吗？
But is there really any such thing as certainty.

7
00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:21.700 
如果包含我们视觉在内的一切都是由概率决定
If everything  even our own vision is governed by probabilities

8
00:36:21.830 --> 00:36:25.060 
还会有任何绝对现实吗？
can there be any absolute reality?

9
00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:30.800 
我们认知里的正统现实
Is there any hope of rescuing our classical idea
